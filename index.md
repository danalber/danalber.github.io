## About Me

**I am a first-year medical student and Vilcek merit scholar at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.**

My research involves the application of artificial intelligence to clinical medicine.
I am a member of the [Orringer lab](https://twitter.com/danorringermd) and the [OLAB](https://www.nyuolab.org/), and work on additional projects in the departments of neurosurgery and neuropathology.

Previously, I was a 4-year varsity swimmer at Brown. 
I graduated in 2022 with honors in applied mathematics-biology, after completing a [thesis](./assets/alber_thesis_final.pdf) in statistical neuroscience under the direction of [Wilson Truccolo](https://www.truccololab.com/).

From 2018-2020 I performed data management, biostatistics, and health services research at the Brigham and Women's [Center for Surgery and Public Health (CSPH)](https://csph.brighamandwomens.org/).

I grew up in Newton, Massachussets and went to Newton South High School.

In my spare time I enjoy operas, art and architecture, photography, and playing electric guitar.
