I am a member of the Orringer Lab and OLAB, and perform additional projects in the departments of Neurosurgery and Neuropathology.

In my spare time I enjoy operas, art and architecture, photography, and playing electric guitar

Previously, I was a 4-year varsity swimmer at Brown. 
I graduated in 2022 with honors in applied mathematics-biology, after completing a thesis in statistical neuroscience under the direction of Wilson Truccolo.

I grew up in Newton, Massachussets and went to Newton South High School.
